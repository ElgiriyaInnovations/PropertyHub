# PropertyHub - replit.md

## Overview

PropertyHub is a full-stack web application that connects buyers, sellers, and brokers in the real estate market. The platform allows users to browse properties, manage listings, communicate through a messaging system, and maintain user profiles. Built with modern technologies, it provides a comprehensive solution for real estate transactions and networking.

## System Architecture

### Full-Stack Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth integration with OpenID Connect
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO for messaging features

### Deployment Strategy
The application is configured for Replit's autoscale deployment with:
- Development mode running on port 5000
- Production build optimized with esbuild for the server
- Vite build for the client-side assets
- PostgreSQL database provisioning through Replit modules

## Key Components

### Database Schema (Drizzle ORM)
Located in `shared/schema.ts`, the database schema includes:
- **Users**: Authentication and profile management (buyers, sellers, brokers)
- **Properties**: Real estate listings with comprehensive metadata
- **Messages & Conversations**: Real-time messaging system
- **Property Favorites**: User wishlist functionality
- **Sessions**: Required for Replit Auth session management

### Authentication System
- Replit Auth integration in `server/replitAuth.ts`
- OpenID Connect strategy with Passport.js
- Session management using PostgreSQL store
- Role-based access control (buyer, seller, broker)

### API Structure
RESTful API endpoints in `server/routes.ts`:
- User authentication and profile management
- Property CRUD operations with filtering
- Messaging system with real-time updates
- Favorites management

### UI Design System
- shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- Responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop
- Dark mode support through CSS variables

## Data Flow

### User Authentication Flow
1. User clicks login â†’ Redirected to Replit Auth
2. Authentication callback updates user session

4. Frontend receives user context through React Query

### Property Management Flow
1. Authenticated users can create/edit property listings
2. Properties are stored with comprehensive metadata (location, price, features)
3. Image uploads handled through the backend API
4. Properties displayed with filtering and search capabilities

### Messaging System
1. Users can initiate conversations about specific properties
2. Real-time messaging through Socket.IO integration
3. Message history persisted in PostgreSQL
